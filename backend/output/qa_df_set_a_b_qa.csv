A total return index reflects both the prices of constituent securities and the reinvestment of all income received.,": D. A total return index reflects both the prices of constituent securities and the reinvestment of all income received.  Explanation: A total return index reflects both the prices of constituent securities and the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. This means that a total return index accounts for both capital appreciation (price changes) and income generated by the securities in the index. By reinvesting all income received, the total return index provides a more comprehensive measure of the overall performance of the index compared to a price return index, which only reflects price changes. Therefore, option D accurately distinguishes a total return index from a price return index. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the differences between the two types of indexes."

Cumulative preference shares, on the other hand, have provisions for dividend payments to be accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Therefore, option B is the correct choice."
41,2. Question: What is the minimum rate of return that stockholders require the company to pay them for investing in its equity called?  Options: A. Accounting return on equity B. Cost of equity C.

The accounting return on equity is the total return that the company earns on shareholders' book equity, not the minimum rate of return required by stockholders.

Venture capital firms provide funding to startups and small businesses that have the potential for high growth. Leveraged buyouts involve acquiring a company using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the cost of acquisition.

43,4. Question: Which type of securities trade like ordinary shares on a local exchange but represent an economic interest in a foreign company?  Options: A. American depository receipts B. Global depository receipts C. Cumulative preference shares D. Callable common shares,": A. American depository receipts  Explanation: American depository receipts (ADRs) are US dollar-denominated securities that trade like standard US securities on US markets but represent an economic interest in a foreign company. ADRs allow investors to invest in foreign companies without having to trade on foreign exchanges. Global depository receipts (GDRs) are similar to ADRs but contain certain restrictions in terms of their ability to be resold among investors. Cumulative preference shares have provisions for dividend payments to be accrued, and callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a predetermined price. Therefore, option A is the correct choice."
44,5. Question: What type of markets are characterized by complete and liquid markets where traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost?  Options: A. Transparent markets B.

Callable preference shares provide investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts.,": B. Non-cumulative preference shares allow investors to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount.  Explanation: Non-cumulative preference shares have no provisions for dividend payments, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are similar to payments made to common shareholders. On the other hand, cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Callable preference shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued."

Return on investment is a broader measure of profitability that includes all sources of capital, not just equity. Dividend yield is the ratio of dividends paid by a company to its shareholders relative to its stock price."

Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders.  Explanation: Preference shares are indeed a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders. This means that preference shareholders have a higher claim on the company's earnings compared to common stockholders. This characteristic distinguishes preference shares from common shares. The other options are incorrect as equity securities historically offer higher returns than government bills and bonds, common shares do give investors a claim on a company's operating performance, and private equity securities are primarily issued to institutional investors in private placements."

This distinction is important as it affects the overall return calculation and performance measurement of the index.
