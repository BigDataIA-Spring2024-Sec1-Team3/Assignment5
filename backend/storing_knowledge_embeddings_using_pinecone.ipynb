Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.  The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective.Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO.Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them.Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place.Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets.Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices.Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult.Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets.A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost.The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital.A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken.Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly.Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs.

Assets can be classified into different categories based on their characteristics and features. Markets, on the other hand, can be classified based on how trading occurs and the level of liquidity they offer.\\n\\nAssets can be classified into various categories such as equities, fixed income securities, derivatives, commodities, and real estate. Equities represent ownership in a company, while fixed income securities represent debt obligations. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, commodity, or index. Commodities are physical goods that can be traded, and real estate represents property or land.\\n\\nMarkets can be classified into primary and secondary markets. Primary markets are where securities are first issued and sold by their issuers, while secondary markets are where these securities are traded after the initial issuance. Markets can also be classified into quote-driven and order-driven markets. Quote-driven markets rely on dealers to provide liquidity and set prices, while order-driven markets match buyers and sellers based on a set of rules.\\n\\nUnderstanding these classifications is essential for financial analysts and investors to make informed decisions about asset allocation and trading strategies.

Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.  The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective.Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO.Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them.Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place.Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets.Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices.Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult.Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets.A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost.The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital.A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken.Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly.Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs.

The leverage ratio is calculated as the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. It indicates the level of exposure to risk that an investor has taken on. \\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Leverage Ratio} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Value of Position}}{\\\\text{Equity}} \\\\]\\n\\nFor example, if an investor has $10,000 in equity and purchases $50,000 worth of securities, the leverage ratio would be 5 ($50,000 / $10,000). This means that for every 1% change in the value of the securities, the investor's equity will change by 5%.\\n\\nUnderstanding the leverage ratio is essential because it magnifies both gains and losses. A higher leverage ratio means that small price movements can result in significant changes in the investor's equity. Additionally, brokers often require maintenance margin payments from investors who have borrowed on margin. If adverse price movements cause the investor's equity to fall below a certain threshold, known as the maintenance margin ratio, the broker may issue a margin call and require additional funds to be deposited to meet the minimum equity requirement.\\n\\nTherefore, investors need to carefully consider their leverage ratio and monitor their positions to avoid margin calls and potential liquidation of their assets. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of how leverage works to make informed investment decisions and manage risk effectively.\", metadata={'source': '../data/output/technical_documents.csv', 'row': 5}),\n",

Market orders are executed at the best available price in the market, ensuring quick execution but potentially at a less favorable price. On the other hand, limit orders are executed at a specific price or better, providing the trader with more control over the execution price but with the risk of the order not being filled if the market does not reach the specified price.\\n\\nThe decision to use a market order or a limit order depends on various factors such as the trader's urgency to execute the trade, the desired execution price, and the market conditions. Market orders are suitable for traders who prioritize speed of execution over price, while limit orders are preferred by traders who want to control the price at which they buy or sell an asset.\\n\\nIn summary, market orders offer quick execution but may result in less favorable prices, while limit orders provide more control over the execution price but may not be filled if the market does not reach the specified price.

Secondary markets support primary markets by providing liquidity to investors who may want to sell their securities after purchasing them in the primary market. This liquidity allows investors to easily exit their positions, which in turn makes primary market investments more attractive.\\n\\nIn the context of financial intermediaries, they play a crucial role in connecting buyers and sellers in both primary and secondary markets. They can act as brokers, exchanges, dealers, or arbitrageurs, facilitating transactions and ensuring smooth operations in the markets. For example, financial intermediaries create instruments through activities like securitization, borrowing to lend, managing investment funds, and pooling insurance contracts. These activities help transform cash flows and risks to meet the specific needs of buyers and sellers.\\n\\nFurthermore, the concept of margin loans is important in understanding how leverage can impact trading in both primary and secondary markets. Margin loans allow investors to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit, increasing their exposure to risk. The leverage ratio, which is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it, determines the potential gains and losses for a given amount of equity.\\n\\nOverall, secondary markets play a vital role in supporting primary markets by providing liquidity to investors and enabling efficient trading of securities.

Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.  The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied.

In quote-driven markets, dealers provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices. On the other hand, order-driven markets match buyers and sellers based on precedence rules, with continuous order-driven markets using the discriminatory pricing rule to determine trade prices. Brokers play a crucial role in connecting buyers and sellers in brokered markets, especially for unique or illiquid instruments.\\n\\nUnderstanding how these markets operate is essential for financial analysts making trading decisions. For example, market orders fill quickly but may result in inferior prices, while limit orders offer better prices but may not fill. Stop instructions can be attached to orders to delay execution until a specific condition is met. Additionally, transaction costs are typically lower in transparent markets where traders can easily determine market value.\\n\\nFurthermore, well-functioning secondary markets are vital for raising capital in primary markets, as investors value the ability to sell securities if needed. Liquid markets with complete and transparent information promote operational efficiency and lower capital-raising costs.

Security market indexes are invaluable tools for investors, who can select from among thousands of indexes representing a variety of security markets, market segments, and asset classes. These indexes range from those representing the global market for major asset classes to those representing alternative investments in specific geographic markets. To benefit from the use of security market indexes, investors must understand their construction and determine whether the selected index is appropriate for their purposes.

       " Document(page_content=\"topic_name: Overview of Equity Securities\\nlearning_outcome: describe characteristics of types of equity securities\\nsummary: Equity securities play a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio management. The importance of this asset class continues to grow on a global scale because of the need for equity capital in developed and emerging markets, technological innovation, and the growing sophistication of electronic information exchange. Given their absolute return potential and ability to impact the risk and return characteristics of portfolios, equity securities are of importance to both individual and institutional investors.  This reading introduces equity securities and provides an overview of global equity markets. A detailed analysis of their historical performance shows that equity securities have offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds, which have provided average real annual returns that have only kept pace with inflation. The different types and characteristics of common and preference equity securities are examined, and the primary differences between public and private equity securities are outlined. An overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets is provided, including a discussion of their risk and return characteristics. Finally, the role of equity securities in creating company value is examined as well as the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, investors’ required rate of return, and the company’s intrinsic value.  We conclude with a summary of the key components of this reading:  Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give investors a claim on its operating performance, the opportunity to participate in the corporate decision-making process, and a claim on the company’s net assets in the case of liquidation.Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued.Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued.Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders.Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are thus similar to payments made to common shareholders.Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation.Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts.Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE).The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the company’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation.

Common shares represent ownership in a company and provide investors with various rights such as participation in decision-making and claims on assets in case of liquidation.

Global depository receipts are similar to ADRs but contain certain restrictions in terms of their ability to be resold among investors.Underlying characteristics of equity securities can greatly affect their risk and return.A company’s accounting return on equity is the total return that it earns on shareholders’ book equity.A company’s cost of equity is the minimum rate of return that stockholders require the company to pay them for investing in its equity.\\ntechnical_document: The relationship between a company's cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, and investors' required rates of return is crucial in investment analysis. The cost of equity represents the minimum rate of return that shareholders demand for investing in a company's equity. On the other hand, the accounting return on equity is the total return earned on shareholders' book equity. Investors' required rates of return are influenced by various factors such as market conditions, company performance, and risk appetite.\\n\\nThese metrics provide insights into the company's financial health and attractiveness to investors. Discrepancies between a company's cost of equity and its accounting return on equity can indicate inefficiencies or risks that may impact investor confidence. Understanding these metrics allows investors to assess the company's ability to generate returns and meet shareholder expectations.\\n\\nIn summary, comparing a company's cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, and investors' required rates of return is essential for evaluating investment opportunities and making informed decisions in the equity market. It helps investors assess the company's performance, risk profile, and attractiveness as an investment option.\", metadata={'source': '../data/output/technical_documents.csv', 'row': 30})]"

Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.  The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective.Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO.Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them.Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place.Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets.Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices.Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult.Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets.A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost.The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital.A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken.Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly.Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs.

Assets can be classified into different categories based on their characteristics and features. Markets, on the other hand, can be classified based on how trading occurs and the level of liquidity they offer.\\n\\nAssets can be classified into various categories such as equities, fixed income securities, derivatives, commodities, and real estate. Equities represent ownership in a company, while fixed income securities represent debt obligations. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset, commodity, or index. Commodities are physical goods that can be traded, and real estate represents property or land.\\n\\nMarkets can be classified into primary and secondary markets. Primary markets are where securities are first issued and sold by their issuers, while secondary markets are where these securities are traded after the initial issuance. Markets can also be classified into quote-driven and order-driven markets. Quote-driven markets rely on dealers to provide liquidity and set prices, while order-driven markets match buyers and sellers based on a set of rules.\\n\\nUnderstanding these classifications is essential for financial analysts and investors to make informed decisions about asset allocation and trading strategies. By knowing the characteristics of different assets and markets, individuals can better assess risk, return potential, and liquidity of their investments.',\n",

The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective.Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO.Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them.Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place.Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets.Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices, display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule, standing limit orders determine trade prices.Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding a buyer or a seller is difficult.Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily manage their trading in transparent markets.A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade. Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to trade at low cost.The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid. Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital.A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that capital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken.Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly.Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs.

The leverage ratio is calculated as the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. It indicates the level of exposure to risk that an investor has taken on. \\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Leverage Ratio} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Value of Position}}{\\\\text{Equity}} \\\\]\\n\\nFor example, if an investor has $10,000 in equity and purchases $50,000 worth of securities, the leverage ratio would be 5 ($50,000 / $10,000). This means that for every 1% change in the value of the securities, the investor's equity will change by 5%.\\n\\nUnderstanding the leverage ratio is essential because it magnifies both gains and losses. A higher leverage ratio means that small price movements can result in significant changes in the investor's equity. Additionally, brokers often require maintenance margin payments from investors who have borrowed on margin. If adverse price movements cause the investor's equity to fall below a certain threshold, known as the maintenance margin ratio, the broker may issue a margin call and require additional funds to be deposited to meet the minimum equity requirement.\\n\\nTherefore, investors need to carefully consider their leverage ratio and monitor their positions to avoid margin calls and potential liquidation of their assets. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of how leverage works to make informed investment decisions and manage risk effectively.\",\n",

Execution instructions are crucial in determining how quickly a trade is completed and at what price. Market orders fill quickly but may result in inferior prices, while limit orders offer better prices but may not fill. Stop instructions can delay trade execution until a specific condition is met. Validity instructions ensure that trades are carried out accurately and efficiently. Clearing instructions, such as those provided by clearinghouses, help manage credit risk and ensure that strangers can contract with each other confidently. \\n\\nIn the context of financial markets, understanding the differences between market orders, limit orders, and stop instructions is essential for traders to make informed decisions about their trading strategies. By comparing the execution speed and potential price impact of each type of order, traders can optimize their trading approach to achieve their desired outcomes. Additionally, recognizing the role of clearing instructions in managing credit risk highlights the importance of reliable clearing mechanisms in facilitating smooth transactions between market participants.',\n",

Market orders are executed at the best available price in the market, ensuring quick execution but potentially at a less favorable price. On the other hand, limit orders are executed at a specific price or better, providing the trader with more control over the execution price but with the risk of the order not being filled if the market does not reach the specified price.\\n\\nThe decision to use a market order or a limit order depends on various factors such as the trader's urgency to execute the trade, the desired execution price, and the market conditions. Market orders are suitable for traders who prioritize speed of execution over price, while limit orders are preferred by traders who want to control the price at which they buy or sell an asset.\\n\\nIn summary, market orders offer quick execution but may result in less favorable prices, while limit orders provide more control over the execution price but may not be filled if the market does not reach the specified price. Traders need to consider these factors when choosing between market orders and limit orders to optimize their trading strategies.\",\n",

Secondary markets support primary markets by providing liquidity to investors who may want to sell their securities after purchasing them in the primary market. This liquidity allows investors to easily exit their positions, which in turn makes primary market investments more attractive.\\n\\nIn the context of financial intermediaries, they play a crucial role in connecting buyers and sellers in both primary and secondary markets. They can act as brokers, exchanges, dealers, or arbitrageurs, facilitating transactions and ensuring smooth operations in the markets. For example, financial intermediaries create instruments through activities like securitization, borrowing to lend, managing investment funds, and pooling insurance contracts. These activities help transform cash flows and risks to meet the specific needs of buyers and sellers.\\n\\nFurthermore, the concept of margin loans is important in understanding how leverage can impact trading in both primary and secondary markets. Margin loans allow investors to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit, increasing their exposure to risk. The leverage ratio, which is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it, determines the potential gains and losses for a given amount of equity.\\n\\nOverall, secondary markets play a vital role in supporting primary markets by providing liquidity to investors and enabling efficient trading of securities. Financial intermediaries also contribute significantly to the functioning of both primary and secondary markets by connecting buyers and sellers and creating instruments that meet the specific needs of market participants.',\n",

Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.  The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to stop losses, they are not always effective.Issuers sell their securities using underwritten public offerings, best efforts public offerings, private placements, shelf registrations, dividend reinvestment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of interests when setting the initial offering price in an IPO.Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash. If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as much for them.Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or their orders) come together at the same time and place.Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets.Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence rules.

In quote-driven markets, dealers provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices. On the other hand, order-driven markets match buyers and sellers based on precedence rules, with continuous order-driven markets using the discriminatory pricing rule to determine trade prices. Brokers play a crucial role in connecting buyers and sellers in brokered markets, especially for unique or illiquid instruments.\\n\\nUnderstanding how these markets operate is essential for financial analysts making trading decisions. For example, market orders fill quickly but may result in inferior prices, while limit orders offer better prices but may not fill. Stop instructions can be attached to orders to delay execution until a specific condition is met. Additionally, transaction costs are typically lower in transparent markets where traders can easily determine market value.\\n\\nFurthermore, well-functioning secondary markets are vital for raising capital in primary markets, as investors value the ability to sell securities if needed. Liquid markets with complete and transparent information promote operational efficiency and lower capital-raising costs. Regulators aim to ensure fair and orderly markets where prices accurately reflect fundamental values without excessive transaction costs.\\n\\nIn summary, understanding the mechanisms of quote-driven, order-driven, and brokered markets is crucial for financial analysts to make informed trading decisions and navigate the complexities of the financial system effectively.',\n",

Different weighting methods can impact the index valuation and returns. The reading mentions various weighting methods, such as price, equal, market-capitalization, and fundamental weightings. These methods determine how the constituents are weighted within the index, which in turn affects the overall performance of the index.\\n\\nFor example, a market-capitalization weighted index will give more weight to companies with higher market capitalizations, reflecting the market value of those companies. On the other hand, an equal-weighted index will assign the same weight to each constituent, regardless of their market capitalizations. This difference in weighting methods can lead to variations in the index returns and valuations.\\n\\nUnderstanding the weighting method used in an index is crucial for investors when selecting an index that aligns with their investment objectives. By analyzing the weighting method, investors can assess how the index is constructed and how it may perform relative to other indexes. Additionally, knowledge of the weighting method can help investors evaluate the level of diversification within the index and the potential risks associated with its constituents.\\n\\nTherefore, calculating and analyzing the value and return of an index requires a deep understanding of the weighting method employed in its construction. Investors must consider the implications of different weighting methods on index performance to make informed decisions regarding their investment strategies.',\n",

The importance of this asset class continues to grow on a global scale because of the need for equity capital in developed and emerging markets, technological innovation, and the growing sophistication of electronic information exchange. Given their absolute return potential and ability to impact the risk and return characteristics of portfolios, equity securities are of importance to both individual and institutional investors.  This reading introduces equity securities and provides an overview of global equity markets. A detailed analysis of their historical performance shows that equity securities have offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds, which have provided average real annual returns that have only kept pace with inflation. The different types and characteristics of common and preference equity securities are examined, and the primary differences between public and private equity securities are outlined. An overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets is provided, including a discussion of their risk and return characteristics. Finally, the role of equity securities in creating company value is examined as well as the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, investors’ required rate of return, and the company’s intrinsic value.  We conclude with a summary of the key components of this reading:  Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give investors a claim on its operating performance, the opportunity to participate in the corporate decision-making process, and a claim on the company’s net assets in the case of liquidation.Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued.Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued.Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders.Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are thus similar to payments made to common shareholders.Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation.Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts.Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE).The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the company’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation.

Common shares represent ownership in a company and provide investors with various rights such as participation in decision-making and claims on assets in case of liquidation. Callable common shares give the issuer the right to repurchase shares at a predetermined price, while putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell shares back to the issuer at a specified price. Preference shares, on the other hand, have priority over common stockholders in terms of dividend payments and liquidation proceeds. Cumulative preference shares accrue unpaid dividends, while non-cumulative preference shares do not.\\n\\nPrivate equity securities are issued to institutional investors in private placements and are not traded on secondary markets. They include venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE). The objective of private equity investing is to enhance long-term value creation by allowing management to focus on operational activities. Depository receipts, such as American depository receipts (ADRs) and global depository receipts (GDRs), enable foreign companies' shares to be traded on international exchanges.\\n\\nUnderstanding the characteristics of equity securities is crucial for investors to assess their risk and return profiles. A company's accounting return on equity reflects the return earned on shareholders' equity, while the cost of equity represents the minimum rate of return required by stockholders. By comprehending these fundamental concepts, investors can make informed decisions when investing in equity securities.\",\n",

Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are thus similar to payments made to common shareholders.Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of liquidation.Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts.Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity (PIPE).The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the company’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value creation. The strategy is to take the “private” company “public” after certain profit and other benchmarks have been met.Depository receipts are securities that trade like ordinary shares on a local exchange but which represent an economic interest in a foreign company. They allow the publicly listed shares of foreign companies to be traded on an exchange outside their domestic market.American depository receipts are US dollar-denominated securities trading much like standard US securities on US markets. Global depository receipts are similar to ADRs but contain certain restrictions in terms of their ability to be resold among investors.Underlying characteristics of equity securities can greatly affect their risk and return.A company’s accounting return on equity is the total return that it earns on shareholders’ book equity.A company’s cost of equity is the minimum rate of return that stockholders require the company to pay them for investing in its equity.\\ntechnical_document: The relationship between a company's cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, and investors' required rates of return is crucial in investment analysis. The cost of equity represents the minimum rate of return that shareholders demand for investing in a company's equity. On the other hand, the accounting return on equity is the total return earned on shareholders' book equity. Investors' required rates of return are influenced by various factors such as market conditions, company performance, and risk appetite.\\n\\nThese metrics provide insights into the company's financial health and attractiveness to investors. Discrepancies between a company's cost of equity and its accounting return on equity can indicate inefficiencies or risks that may impact investor confidence. Understanding these metrics allows investors to assess the company's ability to generate returns and meet shareholder expectations.\\n\\nIn summary, comparing a company's cost of equity, its accounting return on equity, and investors' required rates of return is essential for evaluating investment opportunities and making informed decisions in the equity market. It helps investors assess the company's performance, risk profile, and attractiveness as an investment option.\",\n",

       " 'summary: This reading introduces how the financial system operates and explains how well-functioning financial systems lead to wealthy economies. Financial analysts need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to trading decisions.  The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.  The following points, among others, were made in this reading:  The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade in secondary markets.People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of their managers.Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instrument, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they',\n",
       " 'brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and arbitrageurs.Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage, securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insurance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each other through instruments that meet their specific needs.Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to contract with each other.Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related contract or commodity.Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the leverage ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not satisfy these margin calls.Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade, the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to trade.Stop instructions are attached to other orders']"
