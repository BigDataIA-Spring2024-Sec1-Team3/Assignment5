3|4. Question: What is the difference between price return index and total return index?  Options: A. Price return index reflects prices of constituent securities and reinvestment of all income received. B. Total return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities. C. Price return index does not include the reinvestment of income received. D. Total return index does not reflect the prices of the constituent securities.|: C. Price return index does not include the reinvestment of income received.  Explanation: The key difference between a price return index and a total return index is that a price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities, while a total return index reflects not only the prices but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. This means that the total return index takes into account the reinvestment of dividends or interest earned on the securities in the index, providing a more comprehensive measure of returns. The other options are incorrect as the price return index does not include reinvestment of income, the total return index does reflect the prices of constituent securities, and the price return index reflects only prices without reinvestment.

A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities, while a total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. This distinction is important as it affects the overall return calculation and performance measurement of the index. Option B is incorrect as it provides an inaccurate description of the two types of indexes.

Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders.  Explanation: Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to preference shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common stockholders. This means that preference shareholders have a higher claim on the company's earnings compared to common stockholders. This characteristic distinguishes preference shares from common shares, where common shareholders have a residual claim on the company's earnings after all other obligations have been met. Therefore, option C is the correct statement about equity securities. Option A is incorrect because equity securities have historically offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds. Option B is incorrect because common shares do give investors a claim on a company's operating performance.

Security market indexes are intended to represent the performance of a specific market or segment by tracking the prices of constituent securities. They serve as benchmarks for investors to gauge market sentiment, measure systematic risk, and act as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models. Therefore, option A is the correct purpose of security market indexes. Option B is incorrect because security market indexes do not provide guaranteed returns to investors. Option C is incorrect because diversification is still important in investment portfolios, regardless of the use of indexes. Option D is incorrect because returns on investments can vary based on market conditions and individual investment choices.

Price return index includes interest payments, while total return index does not include interest payments.|: A. Price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities, while total return index reflects the reinvestment of all income received.  Explanation: A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities, while a total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. This means that a total return index provides a more comprehensive measure of the performance of the index by including the impact of reinvested income. Therefore, option A is the correct difference between price return index and total return index. Option B is incorrect because it misstates the difference between the two types of indexes. Option C is incorrect because price return index does not include dividends, while total return index does. Option D is incorrect because interest payments are not typically included in equity security indexes.

Option A is incorrect because diversification is still important in investment portfolios, regardless of secondary market functioning. Option C is incorrect because secondary markets typically have lower transaction costs compared to primary markets.

Reflects the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer as it accurately describes the impact of liquid markets on transaction costs.

Callable preference shares provide investors with the same rights as common share counterparts.|: B. Non-cumulative preference shares allow for dividend payments at the company's discretion.  Explanation: Non-cumulative preference shares do not have provisions for dividend payments to be accrued, meaning that the company can choose whether or not to pay dividends to these shareholders. This makes option B the correct choice. Cumulative preference shares, on the other hand, do have provisions for dividend payments to be accrued. Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Callable preference shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued.
