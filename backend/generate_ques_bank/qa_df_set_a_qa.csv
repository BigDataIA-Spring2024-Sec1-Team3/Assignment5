38|4. Question: What distinguishes a total return index from a price return index?  Options: A. A total return index reflects only the prices of constituent securities. B. A total return index does not include the reinvestment of income received. C. A price return index reflects the reinvestment of all income received. D. A total return index reflects both the prices of constituent securities and the reinvestment of all income received.|: D. A total return index reflects both the prices of constituent securities and the reinvestment of all income received.  Explanation: A total return index reflects both the prices of constituent securities and the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index. This means that a total return index accounts for both capital appreciation (price changes) and income generated by the securities in the index. By reinvesting all income received, the total return index provides a more comprehensive measure of the overall performance of the index compared to a price return index, which only reflects price changes. Therefore, option D accurately distinguishes a total return index from a price return index. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the differences between the two types of indexes.

Therefore, option B accurately describes how financial intermediaries contribute to the functioning of financial markets. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they do not capture the essential role of financial intermediaries in facilitating transactions.

Callable preference shares do not provide issuers with the right to buy back shares.|: B. Non-cumulative preference shares allow for dividend payments to be accrued.  Explanation: Non-cumulative preference shares do not have provisions for dividend payments to be accrued, meaning that the dividend payments are at the company's discretion. This makes them similar to payments made to common shareholders. Cumulative preference shares, on the other hand, have provisions for dividend payments to be accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.
41|2. Question: What is the minimum rate of return that stockholders require the company to pay them for investing in its equity called?  Options: A. Accounting return on equity B. Cost of equity C.

Leveraged buyouts involve acquiring a company using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the cost of acquisition.

Non-cumulative preference shares allow investors to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount.  Explanation: Non-cumulative preference shares have no provisions for dividend payments, implying that the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are similar to payments made to common shareholders. On the other hand, cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders. Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a pre-specified amount. Callable preference shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued.
